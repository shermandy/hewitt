# Hewitt Church Website
This website was created by a former student, Matt McDermott as part of my COM 315 Web Design class. It uses basic HTML and CSS only. I currently maintain the website by updating the calendar and newsletter link.

The website is hosted through Netlify and is available at [https://www.hewittchurch.com](https://www.hewittchurch.com)
