			<h1 class="heading">Mission Statement</h1>
			<p>The mission of the Hewitt Presbyterian Church is to affirm our oneness in Jesus Christ by reaching out to all people, to share our spiritual gifts, and welcome them in celebrating the joys, freedoms, and responsibilities that come with our faith in God. With the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we strive to provide a nurturing atmosphere for all to grow in their knowledge and love of God, as we remain dedicated to strengthening our Christian values of God and family. As the body of Christ, we seek to bear witness to God's love and power while joining together to worship and serve God.</p>	
			<h2 class="heading">The History of Hewitt Presbyterian Church</h2>
			<p>The original Hewitt Presbyterian Church was built in 1871 on farm property donated by Mr. Adam Hewitt Sr.  It was through the efforts of Rev. J.S. Gibson, the Pastor at the time, the 
			church was completed.  Sadly, in 1910, a fire destroyed that white frame building.</p>
			<p>Plans for the current brick church were begun in 1907. Costing approximately $10,000, the brick church was completed in 1909, and dedicated on May 16, 1909. Three stained glass windows and beloved memorials that beautify Hewitt Church both inside and out. The Good Shepherd Window, in memory of A.J. Young, Elder and Sunday School Superintendent during those early years, depicts Christ carrying the lost lamb on his shoulder.  A second window, in memory of Rev. J.S. Gibson, the first Pastor, bears the international symbol of Christian Endeavor, a young people's society at that time, and a Holy Bible.  The third window, placed in memory of Adam Hewitt, upon whose property the church was built, depicts a sheaf of wheat, a reminder that we shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves.</p>
			<p>On July 8, 2010, a Congregational Meeting was held during which a vote was taken to approve the merger of Jefferson Presbyterian Church with Hewitt Church. Members of Hewitt Church graciously welcomed the new members from Jefferson Church into their church family at a special service and merger picnic held on July 25, 2010.  The two congregations, having been previously yoked, have blended well and enjoy working and worshiping together.  Through the merger and the generosity of the Jefferson congregation, Hewitt Church now has a beautifully refurbished pulpit from which the Pastor delivers his sermons, a clavinova which enhances the musical program of the church, and other smaller items which the Jefferson members brought with them to share in worshiping as one congregation.</p>
			<p>Through the years, from its beginnings in the late nineteenth century to the present time, Hewitt Presbyterian Church has continued faithfully in its goal of worshiping and glorifying our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
